PROJECT 2:
DUE 8/29 by 11:11am (before next class)

1. Modify "Loop Update GAME"

2. Create (or grab from else-where) a "Resource.as" which holds the following resources
	- x4 blue enemy bitmaps (same enemy facing different directions)
	- x4 red enemy bitmaps "
	- x4 blue player bitmaps "
	- x4 red player bitmaps "

3. Instead of drawing a color, have each enemy use a bitmap
	- Have the bitmap represent the proper color of the enemy
	- Have the bitmap represent the direction that enemy is moving in

4. Do the same thing with the player
	- The player's bitmap will need to change when direction changes
	- The player's bitmap will need to change when the color changes

5. Be sure to write and include standard readme.txt (as outlined in project #1)

6. When completed upload code to GitHub
	- e-mail me the link to GitHUB


HINTS:
i. "Graphics" or "graphics" should not be anywhere in the final code code

ii. For the Enemy, store a single Bitmap reference; modify x & y in update() 

iii. Make sure your bitmap sizes are twice the halfWidth and halfHeight in the Enemy and Player classes or collision will be wacky
